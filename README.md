# rservlet 6.0
A Hello World Servlet. Files must be in the following structure. That structure can lie in root or any sub folder.

/WEB-INF/web.xml

/WEB-INF/classes/mypack/ServApp.class

/WEB-INF/lib/scala-library-2.13.12.jar + scala3-library_3-3.4.2

So if this is installed on a local machine in the webapps/Hello folder and the port is unchanged from the default the page will display at
http://localhost:8080/Hello/welcome
